# Lit GPT Flow Playground

This is a webapp that will use Lit Web Components to assemble an "OpenAI Prompt workflow". Will add details describing the app's functionality as it is further built out.

## NOTE: As of Monday May 5th, this is still a Work in Progress!
I'm building this app in a day- it should be complete by the morning of Tuesday May the 6th (ideally with a visitable demo)!
