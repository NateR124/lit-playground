# Lit GPT Flow Playground

This is a webapp that will use Lit Web Components to assemble an "OpenAI Prompt" workflow. It's an exercise meant to build something cool, while demonstrating an understanding of various Angular Concepts, Lit Components, etc.

Will add details describing the app's functionality as it is further built out.

## NOTE: As of Monday May 5th, this is still a Work in Progress!

I'm building this app in a day- it should be complete by the morning of Tuesday May the 6th!

If you'd like to look at my webapp as I'm working on it, you can check here: https://lit-gpt-playground.netlify.app/
This link will also host the app once it's complete!
